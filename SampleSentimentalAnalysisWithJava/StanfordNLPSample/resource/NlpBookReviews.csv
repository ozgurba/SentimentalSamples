R1IMH3XDKS52SL,"Old version of python useless","Shoebuddy Jones, Jr.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEYOB6U7H5GRVYOO2ZZPXAQBVPJQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,1,"May 16, 2020","The title says it all: old version of python and code breaks",true,false,
customer_review_foreign-R2U65SPG4Z7HEH,"Excellent introduction to NLP and spaCy",Jim Cooper,,5,"July 6, 2020","I would recommend this book for anyone with some software development experience who wants an introduction to natural language processing. All of the examples are provided as Python code and while it helps to have some experience with Python, it's not a necessary requirement to work through the book and learn the basic NLP concepts. I used Python 3.8 and all the scripts worked perfectly for me. I thought the use of spaCy as a foundational platform was particularly good because spaCy is relatively easy to work with and encapsulates some of the more difficult NLP concepts ""under the hood."" Nice linguistic primer at the end of the book; short but covers what's needed to understand the rest of the content. Also, I really liked the chapter on word vectors. Well done.",true,false,
customer_review_foreign-R3FPFNJMWNXXY4,"Could not get spaCy on MacBook",Glitzy,,1,"February 17, 2021",Before you consider buying this book make sure you can establish spaCy in your environment. The book is useless without it.,true,false,
customer_review_foreign-R2NG32JB954UR,"Good introduction to SPACY for beginner.",LO SIU KEI PEPE,,4,"May 26, 2020","I have preordered this book. So far I have been reading the first 5 chapters and I am quite happy with the content.
It would be good if they can include the solutions for ""try this"".",true,false,
